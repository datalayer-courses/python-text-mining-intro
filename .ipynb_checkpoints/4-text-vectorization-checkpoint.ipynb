    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a shallow, two-layer neural networks which is trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words.\n",
    "It takes as its input a large corpus of words and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space.\n",
    "Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the space.\n",
    "Word2Vec is a particularly computationally-efficient predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text.\n",
    "It comes in two flavors, the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-Gram model.\n",
    "Algorithmically, these models are similar.\n",

    "CBOW predicts target words (e.g. â€˜matâ€™) from the surrounding context words (â€˜the cat sits on theâ€™).\n",
    "Statistically, it has the effect that CBOW smoothes over a lot of the distributional information (by treating an entire context as one observation). For the most part, this turns out to be a useful thing for smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-gram predicts surrounding context words from the target words (inverse of CBOW).\n",
    "Statistically, skip-gram treats each context-target pair as a new observation, and this tends to do better when we have larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a simple neural network with a single hidden layer, and like all neural networks, it has weights, and during training, its goal is to adjust those weights to reduce a loss function. However, Word2Vec is not going to be used for the task it was trained on, instead, we will just take its hidden weights, use them as our word embeddings, and toss the rest of the model.\n",

    "The above explanation is a very basic one. It just gives you a high-level idea of what word embeddings are and how Word2Vec works. Thereâ€™s a lot more to it. For example, to make the algorithm computationally more efficient, tricks like Hierarchical Softmax and Skip-Gram Negative Sampling are used. Moreover, GloVe, which extends the work of Word2Vec to capture global contextual information in a text corpus by calculating a global word-word co-occurrence matrix, and FastText, which works with sub-word tokenization and, as a consequence, can handle out-of-vocabulary words, are also worth looking at. Finally, Googleâ€™s Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT), which became the highlight by the end of 2018 for achieving state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks, can also be used for word's embeddings."
